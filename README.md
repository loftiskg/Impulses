# Impulses

Impulses is a personal finance app that analyzes the bank transactions of a user and identifies nonessential spending habits, like buying a latte in the morning, that could easily be saved. The app allows the users to set up custom rule-based reminders (which we call “Habits”) to save rather than spend money on that purchase. This step will allow us to send the user a text at a time specified by the user to suggest saving that money rather than spending it. If the user replies yes to the message expressing intent to save, the user will receive in-app currency. Users can use the in-app currency to buy entries into a lottery to win cool prizes. The end goal of this product is to engage proactively with users to promote personal savings by encouraging small changes in day to day spending behavior.
